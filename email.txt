Currently, we’re assuming that you want to load these problems and solutions
into the database individually because it would allow any teacher to compose
problems.  Because of the general format of math problems, we are considering an
interface that works with LaTeX, but also allowed an easier method of input that
has push buttons.  Here is an example of such an interface:

LaTeX is a universal and common way of writing math problems in code.  Because
it’s common, it will probably offer instructors the most flexibility:  Aside
from this project, there are several apps like that can be used to generate the
LaTex you’ll probably want in the database.  Here’s an example:

Do you have a teacher interface example that you feel would be more appropriate?

Do you have any comments or concerns about LaTeX?

Do you already have example formats that you have planned for us to utilize
other than LaTeX?

Have you decided if this is a network application or a web app?

Do you have any comments about the possible use of MathJax in a web application?
There are LaTeX examples on the page:
    https://www.mathjax.org/

If this will be a network application, are there any network infrastructure we
should be aware of?
(You may need to run this by the person who administers the school network.)

Do you have any comments, questions or concerns regarding any programming
languages we may consider using?  For example, the use of Visual Basic
would confine the application to the Microsoft environment.

Any other questions for the team?
